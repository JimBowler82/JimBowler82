## Hi there, I'm James ðŸ‘‹

I am a full-stack developer from Worcestershire (UK), recent graduate of the [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/) 16 week bootcamp, and student with the [Open University](http://www.open.ac.uk/courses/computing-it/degrees/bsc-computing-it-software-q62-soft) studying the final year of a Computing & IT degree ðŸŽ“.

I have a background in heavy goods transport and discovered the world of coding when I embarked on my journey with the Open University, now I am working my way towards a career as a developer and help solve problems through tech!

My GitHub repo's feature projects I create through my own learning as well as projects created while working in an agile team with the School of Code.
